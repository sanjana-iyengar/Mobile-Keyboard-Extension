# Mobile-Keyboard-Extension

## Description

The Advoteck Mobile Keyboard Extension is designed to address specific challenges faced by vulnerable individuals, such as seniors or those with cognitive impairments, who may require additional support and protection while using mobile devices for communication. This innovative project aims to enhance digital safety and accessibility by providing a specialized keyboard extension tailored for the needs of dependent users and their caregivers.

What the Project Does: The Mobile Keyboard Extension integrates seamlessly with all devices, offering a familiar typing experience with auto-correct, contextual generalization, and a unique alert system. This alert system is a standout feature that detects and warns users when potentially sensitive information is being shared, ensuring digital safety without compromising user autonomy. Caregivers receive redacted notifications if concerns persist, enabling swift intervention while respecting the privacy of the dependent user.

By providing a specialized keyboard extension with advanced safety features and caregiver notifications, this project aims to mitigate these challenges, enabling vulnerable users to navigate digital communication with confidence while empowering caregivers to provide timely support and intervention when needed.
